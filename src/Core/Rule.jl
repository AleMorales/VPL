"""
    Rule(nodetype; lhs = x -> true, rhs = x -> nothing, captures = false)

Create a replacement rule for nodes of type `nodetype`.

## Arguments
- `nodetype`: Type of node to be matched.  
- `lhs`: Function or function-like object that takes a `Context` object and 
returns whether the node should be replaced or not (with `true` or `false`).
- `rhs`: Function or function-like object that takes one or more `Context`
objects and returns a replacement graph or `nothing`. If it takes several 
inputs, the first one will correspond to the node being replaced.  
- `captures`: Either `false` or `true` to indicate whether the left-hand side
of the rule is capturing nodes in the context of the replacement node to be
used for the construction of the replace graph.

## Details
See VPL documentation for details on rule-based graph rewriting.

## Return
An object of type `Rule`.

## Examples
```julia
let
    struct A <: Node end
    struct B <: Node end
    axiom = A() + B()
    rule = Rule(A, rhs = x -> A() + B())
    rules_graph = Graph(axiom = axiom, rules = rule)
    rewrite!(rules_graph)
end
```

#=
  Match a rule against a graph to identify if it will be replaced and
  capture nodes in the the context of the replaced node, if necessary.
  The function checks that no node is matched by more than one rule as that
  breaks the conceptual parallelism of graph rewriting.
=#
function matchRule!(rule::Rule, node::Context, assigned)
    if captures(rule)
        match, con = rule.lhs(node)
    else

        nid in assigned && error("GraphNode with id $nid was matched by more than one rule")
        push!(rule.matched, nid)
        push!(assigned, nid)

    Match a rule against a graph to identify which nodes will be replaced.
=#

        end
    end
end

#=
  Match all the rules of a dynamic graph against its internal graph
  Rules is needed as argument of the function in order for @unroll to work

end


#=
  Execute a rule by replacing or pruning for every node previously matched.
  Nodes captured in the context of lhs are passed to the rhs
=#
@inbounds function execute!(g::Graph, rule::Rule)
    for i in 1:length(rule.matched)
        id = rule.matched[i]
        context = rule.contexts[i]

end

"""
    rewrite!(g::Graph)

Apply the graph-rewriting rules stored in the graph.

## Arguments
- `g::Graph`: The graph to be rewritten. It will be modified in-place.

## Details
This function will match the left-hand sides of all the rules in a graph. If any
node is matched by more than one rule this will result in an error. The rules
are then applied in order to replaced the matched nodes with the result of
executing the right hand side of the rules. The rules are applied in the order
in which they are stored in the graph but the order in which the nodes are 
processed is not defined. Since graph rewriting is semantically a parallel
process, the rules should not be rely on any particular order for their 
functioning.

## Returns
This function returns `nothing`, but the graph passed as input will be modified
by the execution of the rules.

# Example
```julia
let
    struct A <: Node end
    struct B <: Node end
    axiom = A() + B()
    rule = Rule(A, rhs = x -> A() + B())
    g = Graph(axiom = axiom, rules = rule)
    rewrite!(g)
end
```
